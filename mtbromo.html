 <p> This was one of the most unexpected places I have ever seen. It was the first volcano I saw during my tavels, and it completely blew my socks off.</p>    
 <p> I'm going to set the scene: its 2am in the moring, after me and my friends had just spent two days visting and traveling tough Yogyakarta. We take a long drive in a super cool jeep to the base of the volcano (let's remeber its 2am), and then they leave us to drink a tea or coffe in a bar for two hours, to wait for the sunrise. Another thing I was not super prepared for was the cold. Being in Indonesia, you don't really expect it to be cold, but since Mt. Bromo sits at 7.641 ft, let's just say it got a little chilly at 3am. </p>
 <p> So imagine, its 3 am, me and my friends are all cold and tierd, but at the same time super excited, and then they come out with fried banana, that we later learned is a staple food in volcano hiking in Indonesia. Finally, around 4.30 am, they tell us to go to the top of to prepare for the sunrise. And, oh boy, what a sunrise it was.</p> 
<p> The volcano was erputing, the sky was all different shades of pink, red and orange, and it turly felt like we were in a movie. After this, and a couple of hats with the Mt. Bromo logo bough, they brough us down to the base of the volano, again in the super cool jeep, to then go actually hike (it was like 200 stairs) to see the mouth of the volcano.</p>

<p> This vocano was more of a challenge that Mount Bromo, but still as beautiful. Same as Mt. Bromo, it involved a wake up call at 2am, tea or hot chocolate and, of course, fried banana. There was a big difference though, it actually incolved a hike. BUT, the really peculiar thing about this volcano, is that, if the timing is correct, you can acually see the pheonoenon of blue fire!</p>
<p> Now, what is blue fire? It's actually quite simple, it's just a chemical reaction caused by the ignition of sulfuric gases. These gases escape from volcanic vents, and when they come into contact with air, they burn with a vivid blue color. However, if your guide tells you that there is a very slight chance that you will experience this pheonomenon, please listen to him. Me and a friend got separated by the rest of the group because we were walking a little bit slower, and theywere sprinting up, almost running, that fro me and Lucca, was just not in the plan. </p>
    <p> I have some advice for anybody who is planning on doing this hike:</p>
<ol class="ijen-list"> 
    <li> Do not eat too much fried banana before starting to go up, it will hurt your stomach</li>   
    <li> Wear many many layers, it will get very cold at the top</li>
    <li> Do not sprint up the volcano if your guide tells you that there is a very little chance that you will see the blue fire </li>
    <li> Skip going down to the volcanic vents and enjoy the beautiful sunrise overlooking the sea</li>
        </ol>

<p> Now this, this was really a challenge. I don't really know what I was thinking when I decided to do this hike, since I had never done any kind of hiking prior to this. This was truly very hard for me and I honesty don't know if, looking back, I would do again.</p>
<p> So, the important part to not of this hike is how much elevation you do in the arc of 2 days. Here is a look at the schedule: </p>

    <!-- nested list: https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_nested -->
  <ul class="list-rinjani">
      <li> Day 1: The day actually starts at night, where the company you booked the hike with brings you to their hostel to sleep for the night. They also give you a prwview of what to expect. And then to bed before the big day</li>
      <li> Day 2
        <ul> 
      <li> Wake up call: 6am</li>
            <li> Sart treck: 9am - starting point of elevation 1156m </li>
            <li> Treck to Pos 1: 1300m </li>
            <li> Treck to Pos 2: 1500m</li>
            <li> Treck to Pos 3: 1800m</li>
            <li> Treck to the Crater Rim (where you rest for the night): 2639m</li>     
</ul> </li>
      <li> Day 3
      <ul> 
      <li> Wake up call: 1 am</li>
         <li> Treck to the summit to see the sunrise (if you get there in time to see it): 3726m</li>
          <li> Back to camp and a well deserved breakfast</li>
          <li> Treck back to the sarting point </li>
      </ul></li>
        </ul>      
<p> As you ca see, you will almost 3000 meters of elevation in under 24 hours, for then to walk them all back down in just under 6 hours. Overall, it was a lot for the body to endure on a radom Thursday with no preparation.</p>
